# ConnectZen

## PROBLEM
### The idea of ConnectZen was identified due to the current coronavirus pandemic. This crisis has forced us into lockdowns and away from loved ones. As more and more of us are working from home, our work life balance has blurred, in turn leading to longer work-hours and limited time for social interaction. While socializing virtually has been of some help as a substitute to in-person human connections during this time, it can be very difficult if you don’t have organized ways of connecting with others. This amalgam of social isolation and overworking has led to increased widespread loneliness and emotional distress among many.

## SOLUTION
### This is where ConnectZen comes in! We’ve developed an app that provides a convenient and organized way to schedule meetups with loved ones so that you can connect when you want. You won’t feel isolated, nor will you be overwhelmed by a litany of meetings (aka “zoom fatigue”) anymore - a perfect balance to keep you close to people and emotionally healthy in this socially distant and distressing time. Our scheduling algorithm takes all of your preferences into account to ensure... meetups are scheduled in your free time. You choose when and how many times to meet someone, so now there’s nothing holding you back from staying connected with others! To stay motivated, track your progress and make sure it’s going up as you engage in more and more meetups, and invite those who aren’t on the app yet, to join! Make reaching out to people more contagious than the virus itself.

### ConnectZen helps you connect with your loved ones in 3 easy steps. Just add in your favorite contacts to stay in touch with, feed in any preferences for when and how often you want to meet them and finally hit the “sheh dule schedule events” button. The app will then work diligently to schedule your meetings for the upcoming month in accordance with your preferences. All your future meetings can be scheduled with just a tap, as your preferences are automatically saved by the app.
